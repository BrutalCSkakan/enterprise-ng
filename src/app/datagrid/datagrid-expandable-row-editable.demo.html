    1) Click on one of the + icons and edit the value in the expanded row.
  </p>
  <p>
    2) Now click on either Quantity or Price and now try to edit the value in
    the expanded row. This is broken as the focus is continually lost.
  </p>
  <p>
    3) Now click on the Order Date and now edit in the expanded row (which now

    1) Click on one of the + icons and try to edit the value in the expanded
    row. This is broken because in this DataGrid the cell containing the +
    expander icon has an editor. It fails if the editor is Input, Date or
    CheckBox.
